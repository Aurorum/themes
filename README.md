Automattic's free themes.

## Maintainers

These themes are maintained by the [Automattic Theme Team](https://themeshaper.com/about/).

## Submitting issues

Before submitting your issue, make sure it has not been discussed earlier. You can search for existing tickets [here](https://github.com/Automattic/themes/search).

Here are some tips to consider and to help you write a great report:

* Themes support Microsoft Internet Explorer 11 and Edge, as well as the latest two versions of all other major browsers.
* Themes are backwards compatible with the two versions prior to the current stable version of WordPress.
* Themes use HTML5 markup.
* Translation files should not be included in PRs, as these are handled by WordPress.com. [See here for information on contributing to i18n efforts on WordPress.com](https://translate.wordpress.com/).

## Contributing code

Found a bug you can fix? Fantastic! Patches are always welcome. Here are a couple tips for crafting a great pull request:

* Include the purpose of your PR. Be explicit about the issue your PR solves.
* Reference any existing issues that relate to your PR. This allows everyone to easily see all related discussions.
